Note: The Jupyter notebook in this repository may not render properly on GitHub due to missing or incompatible widget metadata (metadata.widgets.state).
This can cause errors like:
"There was an error rendering your Notebook: the 'state' key is missing from 'metadata.widgets'"

Despite this, the notebooks work perfectly when downloaded and run on Google Colab. All code cells and outputs are intact.
